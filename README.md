# Knapsack Problem Algorithm in Python  

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Knapsack Problem**, created as part of coursework for the subject *Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks* at DSW. The algorithm efficiently solves the combinatorial optimization problem of selecting items to maximize the total value within a given weight limit.

## Features  
- Implements a classic **0/1 Knapsack Problem** algorithm.
- Highlights key steps in the computation using colored terminal outputs for better readability.

## Requirements  

Before running the program, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:  
- **pandas**: For structured data handling and analysis.
- **colorama**: For color-coded terminal output.

Install the required libraries with the following command:  
```bash
pip install pandas colorama
